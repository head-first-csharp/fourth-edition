# Welcome to the Head First C# Unity Labs!

Writing code is a skill, and like any other skill, getting better at it takes **practice and experimentation**. [Unity](https://unity.com/) is be a really valuable tool for that.

Unity is a cross-platform game development tool that you can use to make professional-quality games, simulations, and more. It’s also a fun and satisfying way to **get practice with the C# tools and ideas** you’ll learn throughout *Head First C#*. We designed these short, targeted labs to reinforce the concepts and techniques you just learned to help you hone your C# skills.

These labs are an optional part of the book, but valuable practice—even if you aren’t planning on using C# to build games.

## Unity Lab code

You can find the code for the Unity Lab projects in the [`Code/Unity_Labs/ folder`](https://github.com/head-first-csharp/fourth-edition/tree/master/Code/Unity_Labs/). You can load a project into Unity by:
 * Downloading it (or cloning this whole repository)
 * Adding its folder to Unity Hub
 * Opening it in Unity Hub
 * Opening *SampleScene* from the *Scenes* folder
