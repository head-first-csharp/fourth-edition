## What will you learn from this book?

Dive into C# and create apps, user interfaces, games, and more using this fun and highly visual introduction to C#, .NET Core, and Visual Studio. With this completely updated guide, which covers C# 8.0 and Visual Studio 2019, beginning programmers like you will build a fully functional game in the opening chapter. Then you'll learn how to use classes and object-oriented programming, create 3D games in Unity, and query data with LINQ. And you'll do it all by solving puzzles, doing hands-on exercises, and building real-world applications. By the time you're done, you'll be a solid C# programmer--and you'll have a great time along the way!

## What's so special about this book?

Based on the latest research in cognitive science and learning theory, Head First C# uses a visually rich format to engage your mind rather than a text-heavy approach that puts you to sleep. Why waste your time struggling with new concepts? This multisensory learning experience is designed for the way your brain really works.

***NOTE:** The downloadable projects for these chapters are **early release** PDFs! That means that while the code works, the projects are complete, and we've done our initial review of them, we're still working on polishing them up and putting the final touches on them. But you can definitely start using them today!**

## Download all of the Unity Labs

### Unity Labs from the book

In the *Head First C# Unity Labs* you'll use [Unity](https://unity.com/), the powerful platform for 2D and 3D game development, to explore C# and practice your C# skills.

### Additional Unity Labs

There's more to learn about Unity! We've written additional Unity Labs that go beyond the material in the book to teach you important Unity topics, and give you more practice building 3D games.
* [`Unity_Lab_7.pdf`](https://github.com/head-first-csharp/fourth-edition/raw/master/Unity_Labs/Unity_Lab_7.pdf) – Physics

* `Unity_Lab_10.pdf` - robots (coming soon!)

### Unity Lab code

You can find the code for the Unity Lab projects in the [`Unity_Labs/Projcts folder`](https://github.com/head-first-csharp/fourth-edition/tree/master/Unity_Labs/Projects). You can load a project into Unity by:
 * Downloading it (or cloning this whole repository)
 * Adding its folder to Unity Hub
 * Opening it in Unity Hub
 * Opening *SampleScene* from the *Scenes* folder

## All of the additional material that you can download

Here's what you'll find in this repository:
* [`Head_First_CSharp_4e_chapters_1_to_4.pdf`](https://github.com/head-first-csharp/fourth-edition/raw/master/Head_First_CSharp_4e_chapters_1_to_4.pdf) – a PDF of the first four chapters, including the first two Unity Labs and the *Visual Studio for Mac Learner's Guide* appendix
* [`Unity Labs`](Unity_Labs) – PDFs and graphics files for the Unity Lab projects throughout the book
* [`Billiard Ball Textures`](Unity_Labs/Billiard_Balls) – billiard ball textures for the Unity Lab projects

## Did you run into trouble with the project in the first chapter?

In the first chaper you jump right into a project to create an animal matching game to help you start learning about C# and Visual Studio. We've had many readers do this project—so don't worry, it definitely works! (In fact, some of our readers got especially creative with the project. You can [read more about it on the Visual Studio blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/head-first-csharp-contest-got-some-truly-creative-entries/).)

While most readers are able to do this project without any trouble, you could run into problems if your code doesn't match the code in the book **exactly**. Here's what to do if you run into trouble with the project in the first chapter:
* Compare the code line by line. It's really easy to miss a comma, semicolon, parentheses, equals sign, etc.
* If you're following the WPF version, make sure that your XAML matches the XAML in the book **exactly**. If you're missing a TextBlock, you'll get an `ArgumentOutOfRangeException`.
* If you're following the ASP.NET Blazor version, make sure that your HTML markup matches the markup in the book **exactly**.

If you're still having trouble, watch the video walkthrough for the project on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnbMYjZgh6fSB6BBww1Wfbw/featured). It shows every step in the project so you can see exactly what you're supposed to do.

### Are you getting "Debugger operation failed" when you start your Blazor app?

If you're following the Visual Studio for Mac Learner's Guide, the very first step is creating an ASP.NET Blazor WebAssembly App project and running it. If you run into an "Unable to launch browser" error or an error that mentions certificates, it probably means there's a small setup issue that you need to fix. Open Terminal and run the following commands:

 1. Change `Properties/launchSetting.json/` and move the ports from 5000 and 5001 to somthing else (try changing to 5006 and 5007 respectively)
 2. Open Terminal
 3. Type:  `$ dontnet dev-certs https --clean`
 4. Then Type: `$ dotnet dev-certs https --trust`
 5. Try again

This redeploys the developer certificates, which lets your browser trust Visual Studio to allow debugging.

_special thanks to [Twitter user Chris Jackson @Sirhc7001](https://twitter.com/Sirhc7001/status/1354489560093265920) for **very quickly** finding the solution! You can read more about it here: [`dotnet quits unexpectedly on mac os #12317`](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/12317)_

## Did you find an error in the book?

We worked really hard to make this book as error-free as possible! But we're only human, and we do occasionally make mistkaes. If you spot an error in the book, please use the [O'Reilly errata page](https://www.oreilly.com/catalog/errata.csp?isbn=9781491976708) to let us know about it. That way it goes into a database so we can keep track of it and fix it in future printings.
