## Read the first four chapters today!

We're pleased to share the **[Early Release chapters](https://github.com/head-first-csharp/fourth-edition/raw/master/EarlyRelease/Head_First_Csharp_4th_Edition_Early_Release.pdf)** with you! Check out the early versions of chapters 1 through 4, the early edition of the _Visual Studio for Mac Learner's Guide_ appendix, and the first two much-anticipated Unity labs: [Head_First_Csharp_4th_Edition_Early_Release.pdf](https://github.com/head-first-csharp/fourth-edition/raw/master/EarlyRelease/Head_First_Csharp_4th_Edition_Early_Release.pdf)

## When is it coming out?

We're really hard at work finishing this book! The [Amazon page](https://www.amazon.com/Head-First-CSharp/dp/1491976705/) has a release date of November 2020, and we think that's accurate! After the book is officially released and sent to print, it usually takes about a week for the eBook versions to be available, and about three weeks for the printer to ship books to bookstores and Amazon warehouses.
